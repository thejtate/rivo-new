                <p>Where do I begin... This by far has been the absolute best company I have ever worked for! You couldn't create a better company if it was written in a story book!! The values, the integrity, the morals. The positive consistency of treatment. I've been there for 3 years and don't plan on going anywhere. This is the type of company that provides excellent upward mobility and room to grow very QUICKLY! The benefits are amazing! The people are amazing! Upper Management are Rockstars! The office is influenced by the most state of the art architecture you've ever seen! By far one of the most comfortable places I've had the pleasure to work for and become a part of. If you are looking for Job Security, Good benefits, Good people, the Best Owner, unique qualities, and a hardworking upper management staff, then you've found the right place.

                <p>Where do I begin... This by far has been the absolute best company I have Rivo is honestly the best company I have worked for. Any job can be just a job when you have the wrong mindset, but this company is so much more than the work we do. The owner makes it a point to give as much respect and heart to his employees that he wants his employees to give to the company. The work we do on a daily basis provides financial assistance for people in need, and although we do have goals and quotas to meet, the perks of this office are great. From Snack Wednesdays to the team building events to the holiday parties, you can really tell that this company cares about their employees and cares about how their employees feel about the company. Rivo is so accommodating, and the owner’s door is always open should you feel that you can't go to anyone else. It's really great to have found a company with this much heart and employee care when some work for their whole lives and never see appreciation like we here at Rivo do. If you have the chance to work here, I say go for it, it'll be the best decision you ever make.

                <p>The company just moved to a really nice office downtown. Comfortable work environment, lots of space in the break room, great view of Coronado and Balboa Park, lots of tvs, touch screen coffee machines etc. Overall a good company to work for. Good training and opportunity to make good money in bonus. Generally fun work environment, everyone works well together and people end up being friends.</p>

You were so nice and awesome, wish you were the one I talked to when i told that one person that I want every penny that I owed you guys to come out on this day, he says no problem, and when that day came , only the minimum was taken out.. so then I had to use my debit card... So I was just was a little upset because of this .. anyways had to be miscommunication, and u know, that's life... so anyways, Lena u were wonderful and thanks again for your help..</p>
