          <div class="desc">
              <p>As the manager of our Analytics and Underwriting Department, Dulce Garcia was originally an unlikely candidate for a career in numbers.  With a Fashion Merchandising background emphasis, Miss Garcia wasn’t formally instructed in financial services.  However, after joining the Rivo team in 2011 as a Loan Specialist, she quickly exhibited a knack for numerical figures and trending analysis.  Additionally, she showed a certain je ne sais quoi as it related to customer interaction and she was promoted up through the ranks; first as a New Business Team Lead then as a New Business Manager.  Ultimately, Miss Garcia showed a great proclivity toward number recognition and was commissioned with starting a team of people tasked in understanding consumer relationships and behaviors.  This team, now under the designation of Analytics and Underwriting Department, is one of the most significant groups within the organization relating to an understanding of Consumer Behavior.  From the innocence of a fashion devotee, Miss Garcia represents the successful growth, maturity, and grass roots experience that is common at Rivo Holdings. </p>

            <p>Identifying correct talent is somewhat of an art.  For most, it takes a combination of insight, investigative questioning, and often years of experience.  For others, like Alyssa Ramirez, perhaps intuition and a little gut instinct play a role.  Hired to Rivo Holdings in 2014 as a Loan Specialist, Miss Ramirez was a fast rising star.  She excelled as a frontline specialist and quickly showed her maturity, composure, and exceptional decision making aptitude.  Within a year she was promoted through the ranks to a New Business Manager.  Most notably however, she made a compelling case to step into the role as Rivo’s Hiring Manager.  Her frontline experience coupled with her ability to identify strong talent skills has led to a successful stream of highly talented team members and a consistently low rate of talent turnover. at is common at Rivo Holdings. </p>

          </div>
          <div class="desc">
            <p>As the story goes, Rivo Holdings was born from a computer on a cardboard box, a phone, a Rolodex, and a determined young gentleman.  It wasn’t too long before that determined gentleman was too busy to complete the things he needed to in a given day’s time.  He needed additional help and he thus hired his first unassuming employee, Soleil Intrabartolo.  Since 2009, Soleil has successfully worked both on the frontline at Rivo and as a Team Manager.  Miss Intrabartolo now oversees one of the more significant areas of service, Customer Loyalty and Retention.  The Department’s sole focus is Customer Reengagement.  Her long-term organization loyalty, investment in employee support, and insatiable pursuit of customer experience excellence, makes for a superlative fit for this critical role.   </p>
